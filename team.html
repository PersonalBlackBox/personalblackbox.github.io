                His Internet career began at a time when the Internet was just in its infancy. Vaughn was among the early web pioneers who adopted the new technology and explored its potentials. His pioneering spirit was noticed by America Online and was drafted to be part of its nascent business unit, the AOL Greenhouse.  There, Vaughn’s innate technical skills were further honed in creating unique online programming and interactive services for AOL, the Internet and beyond. Thus began a career of merging Internet technology with business needs.  From there Vaughn went on to assignments in many different sectors, including the financial sector with Cantor Fitzgerald/eSpeed, advertising with Grey Global, and scientific/non-profit with the American Geophysical Union and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and along the way worked on many national and e-commerce brands to include M&M's, Starburst, Skittles, Aveda, Clinique, Estee Lauder, and others
                <br><br>
                Now primarily focused in project management, Vaughn synthesizes his background in technology, software development, design, UX, sales, marketing, business and infrastructure to drive successful business outcomes.
